            <h1>Samsung vs. iPhone: Which One Should You Get?</h1>
            <img class=" vs"  src="../img/vs.jpg" alt="iphonevssamsung">
            <p>Without a doubt, one of the biggest rivalries in the tech world is the one between Android and iOS phones. Samsung, as probably the best and most popular manufacturer of Android phones, champions this mobile operating system. On the other side of the battlefield, it’s none other than Apple. So, Samsung vs. iPhone – which one is better? In this review, we’ll compare the phones produced by these two manufacturers across several areas, including design, privacy, performance, and more.

                Of course, a lot of differences between Samsung phones and those produced by Apple boil down to how their respective operating systems function, which is a topic we’ll also cover in this article. We’ll focus on their newest flagship smartphones, the best models both companies have to offer: the Samsung Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12.</p>
