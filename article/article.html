        <P>As reported by Rolling Stone, that limit has now been raised to 10,000 songs — and you can download that many tunes on five different devices instead of just three. So you’re looking at 50,000 in all. “At Spotify, we’re always working on improving the experience for our users,” a company spokesperson told Rolling Stone.</P>
