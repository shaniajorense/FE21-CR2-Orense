        <h1>Asia's Culture</h1>
        <p>The culture of Asia encompasses the collective and diverse customs and traditions of art, architecture, music, literature, lifestyle, philosophy, politics and religion that have been practiced and maintained by the numerous ethnic groups of the continent of Asia since prehistory. Identification of a specific culture of Asia or universal elements among the colossal diversity that has emanated from multiple cultural spheres and three of the four ancient River valley civilizations is complicated. However, the continent is commonly divided into six geographic sub-regions, that are characterized by perceivable commonalities, like culture, religion, language and relative ethnic (racial) homogeneity. These regions are Central Asia, East Asia, North Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia.</p>

        <h1>American's Culture</h1>
        <p>American societies can be broadly categorized into two: rural societies and urban societies. Even though rural areas cover a vast majority of the American territory, less than 20% of the total population live in rural areas. Rural communities are considered to be more closely knit than urban societies as most people know each other. Regardless of where they are from, Americans have a reputation as some of the friendliest people on earth due to their readiness to go out of their way for a complete stranger. </p>
